ABSTRACT = {Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can be used to represent ownership of digital art or any other unique digital item where ownership is recorded in smart contracts on a blockchain. NFTs have recently received enormous attention from both cryptocurrency investors and the media. We examine why NFTs have gotten so much attention. Using vector autoregressive models, we show that Bitcoin returns significantly predict next week&rsquo;s NFT growth in popularity, measured by Google search queries. Moreover, wavelet coherence analysis suggests that Bitcoin and Ether returns are significant drivers of next week&rsquo;s attention to NFTs. These results indicate that the remarkable increases in prices of major cryptocurrencies can explain the hype around NFTs.},

        abstract = {Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are digital assets that represent objects like art, collectible, and in-game items. They are traded online, often with cryptocurrency, and are generally encoded within smart contracts on a blockchain. Public attention towards NFTs has exploded in 2021, when their market has experienced record sales, but little is known about the overall structure and evolution of its market. Here, we analyse data concerning 6.1 million trades of 4.7 million NFTs between June 23, 2017 and April 27, 2021, obtained primarily from Ethereum and WAX blockchains. First, we characterize statistical properties of the market. Second, we build the network of interactions, show that traders typically specialize on NFTs associated with similar objects and form tight clusters with other traders that exchange the same kind of objects. Third, we cluster objects associated to NFTs according to their visual features and show that collections contain visually homogeneous objects. Finally, we investigate the predictability of NFT sales using simple machine learning algorithms and find that sale history and, secondarily, visual features are good predictors for price. We anticipate that these findings will stimulate further research on NFT production, adoption, and trading in different contexts.}

abstract="Non-fungible tokens are one of the most important future application domains for smart contracts. Ethereum is the pioneer of a blockchain-based decentralized computing platform that has ultimately standardized these types of tokens into a well-defined interface, now known as ERC-721. Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have received extensive attention recently. Massive data has been stored on permissionless blockchains. This paper aims to analyze blockchain and cryptocurrencies' technical underpinnings, specifically non-fungible tokens or ``crypto-collectibles,'' with the help of a blockchain-based image matching game. While outlining the theoretical implications and use cases of NFTs, this paper also gives a glimpse into their possible use in the domain of human user verification to prevent misuse of public data by automated scripts. This demonstrates the interaction of the ERC-721 token with the Ethereum-based decentralized application. Further, we aim to reach a definitive conclusion on the benefits and challenges of NFTs and thus reach a solution that would be beneficial to both researchers and practitioners.",

abstract = {In recent times, image segmentation has been involving everywhere including disease diagnosis to autonomous vehicle driving. In computer vision, this image segmentation is one of the vital works and it is relatively complicated than other vision undertakings as it needs low-level spatial data. Especially, Deep Learning has impacted the field of segmentation incredibly and gave us today different successful models. The deep learning associated Generated Adversarial Networks (GAN) has presenting remarkable outcomes on image segmentation. In this study, the authors have presented a systematic review analysis on recent publications of GAN models and their applications. Three libraries such as Embase (Scopus), WoS, and PubMed have been considered for searching the relevant papers available in this area. Search outcomes have identified 2084 documents, after two-phase screening 52 potential records are included for final review. The following applications of GAN have been emerged: 3D object generation, medicine, pandemics, image processing, face detection, texture transfer, and traffic controlling. Before 2016, research in this field was limited and thereafter its practical usage came into existence worldwide. The present study also envisions the challenges associated with GAN and paves the path for future research in this realm.}
