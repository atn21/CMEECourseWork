R input and output.

### 2. control_flow.R

Control flow in R.

### 3. break.R

How to break out of a loop.

### 4. next.R

How to use next.

### 5. boilerplate.R

A boilerplate R script.

### 6. R_conditionals.R

How to use conditionals.

### 7. TreeHeight.R

Calculates heights of trees given distance of each tree from its base and angle to its top. 

### 8. Vectorize1.R

Utilise vectorization instead of performing the operation element-wise.

### 9. preallocate.R

Preallocation help speed up loop.

### 10. apply1.R

Use **apply** to perform function on a matrix.

### 11. apply2.R

Return input times 100 if sum of input is greater than 0. 

### 12. sample.R

Use of lapply and sapply.

### 13. Ricker.R

Run a simulation of the Ricker model and return a vector of length generations.

### 14. Vectorize2.R

Run the stochastic Ricker equation with gaussian fluctuations and the vectorized version of the function.

### 15. browse.R

How to use **browser()** to debug.

### 16. try.R

How to use **try()** to catch errors.

### 17. Florida_warming.R

Calculate the correlation coefficients between temperature and time through the use of a permutation analysis.

### 18. Florida_warming.tex

Compiles the report which contains the output of Florida_warming.R into a pdf.

### 19. DataWrang.R

How to wrangle data with R packages. 

### 20. DataWrangTidy.R

Use tidyverse for the data wrangling component in DataWrang.R.
