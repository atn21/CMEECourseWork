## List of scripts

### 1. basic_io.R

R input and output.

### 2. control_flow.R

Control flow in R.

### 3. break.R

How to break out of a loop.

### 4. next.R

How to use next.

### 5. boilerplate.R

A boilerplate R script.

### 6. R_conditionals.R

How to use conditionals.

### 7. TreeHeight.R

Calculates heights of trees given distance of each tree from its base and angle to its top. 

### 8. Vectorize1.R

Utilise vectorization instead of performing the operation element-wise.

### 9. preallocate.R

Preallocation help speed up loop.

### 10. apply1.R

Use **apply** to perform function on a matrix.

### 11. apply2.R

Return input times 100 if sum of input is greater than 0. 

### 12. sample.R

Use of lapply and sapply.

### 13. Ricker.R

Run a simulation of the Ricker model and return a vector of length generations.

### 14. Vectorize2.R

Run the stochastic Ricker equation with gaussian fluctuations and the vectorized version of the function.

### 15. browse.R

How to use **browser()** to debug.

### 16. try.R

How to use **try()** to catch errors.

### 17. Florida_warming.R

Calculate the correlation coefficients between temperature and time through the use of a permutation analysis.

### 18. Florida_warming.tex

Contains the report for Florida_warming.R, written in LaTeX.

### 19. DataWrang.R

How to wrangle data with R packages. 

### 20. DataWrangTidy.R

Use tidyverse for the data wrangling component in DataWrang.R.

### 21. PP_Dists.R

Draw the distributions of predator mass, prey mass, and the size ratio of prey mass to predator mass by feeding interaction type. Use logarithms of masses (or size ratios) for all three plots. In addition, the script calculates the (log) mean and median predator mass, prey mass and predator-prey size-ratios to a csv file.

### 22. Girko.R

Plot the Girko's law simulation.

### 23. MyBars.R

How to annotate a plot. 

### 24. plotLin.R

Mathematical annotation on an axis and in the plot area.

### 25. PP_Regress.R

Perform regression analysis and save the corresponding regression results a csv file.

### 26. GPDD_Data.R

A world map which has data in GPDD superimposed on top.

### 27. TAutoCorr.R

Calculate the correlation coefficients between temperature of successive years in Florida.

### 28. TAutoCorr.tex

Contains the report for TAutoCorr.R, written in LaTeX.

### 29. CompileLaTeX.sh

Convert the TAutoCorr.tex

### 30. get_TreeHeight.R

Takes a csv file name from the command line and outputs the result to a file just like TreeHeight.R.

### 31. get_TreeHeight.py

The Python version of get_TreeHeight.R, it also takes a csv file name from the command line and outputs the result to a file just like TreeHeight.R.

### 32. run_get_TreeHeight.sh

A bash script for running *get_TreeHeight.py* and *get_TreeHeight.R*.
